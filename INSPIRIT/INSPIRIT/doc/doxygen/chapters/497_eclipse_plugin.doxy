The installation is now done.

\section PluginInstallation StarPU Eclipse Plugin Compilation and Installation

StarPU can now be compiled and installed with its Eclipse plugin. To
do so, you first need to configure StarPU with the option \ref
enable-eclipse-plugin "--enable-eclipse-plugin". The Eclipse IDE
executable \c eclipse must be in your \c PATH.

\verbatim
export PATH=$HOME/usr/local/eclipse/java-2021-03/eclipse:$PATH
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=$HOME/usr/local/starpu --enable-eclipse-plugin
make
make install
\endverbatim

The StarPU Eclipse plugin is installed in the directory \c dropins.

\verbatim
$ ls $HOME/usr/local/eclipse/java-2021-03/eclipse/dropins
StarPU_1.0.0.202105272056.jar
\endverbatim

You can now go to Section \ref EclipsePluginUsage to see how to use
the plugin.
